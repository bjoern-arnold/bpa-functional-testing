## BPA Functional Testing

This project is intended as a showcase to illustrate how requirements and related functional tests can be specified using Serenity BDD. So far, the following features have been specified:

* The _Invitation Management_ requirements, which are declared as __manual tests__ , and
* The _Organization Profile Management_ requirements, which demonstrate how to use RESTassured for implementing REST tests.
* The _Post Codes_ requirements, which demonstrate the use of tabular test data for a scenario.
